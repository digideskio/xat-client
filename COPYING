I do not know if I can release this under a free or open source license, as this
software was not built with clean-room design.

No parts of the code were copy+pasted from the decompiled actionscript (see
chat.as3) and they have significantly different architecture (I like to think
mine is better, but of course that could just be the decompiler's handiwork),
but I cannot prove this isn't a derived work, as I used chat.as3 heavily for
reference.

That said, if this serves a useful purpose to you, please feel free to fork,
change, and use anything but chat.as3, chat445.swf, and loader.as3 as you
desire; however, by doing so, you implicitly agree to accept full legal
responsibility for your actions (don't sue me if xat comes after you.) In
clearer words, I (the author) don't care what you do with this, but Xat might.

If Xat (or its parent company) decides to send me a cease and desist order, I
WILL take this down, as I have no legal basis in developing this software.
