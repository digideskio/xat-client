echo -n -e "<policy-file-request/>\000" | nc 174.36.242.42 10037

Code is in chat.as3. Not sure what to make of it.
for example, ReLogin(): network.NetworkClose();

there's a 'public class global' and a 'public class todo', all full of class
variables. yuck.
onMsg is line chat.as3:5596.
line 10825 is 'doXatIM', which appears to parse CSV.
network begins in 12169

A transcript of my conversation with the server. The . at the end of every tag
is a \00 character. > is sent, < is recieved. attributes: u seems to be user ID
(numeric), n is name (if applicable), email and imtype? perhaps

<y> is some kind of authentication.
<p> is a private message.
<c> is a control message.
<m> is a message.
messages with attr t beginning with "/" (FirstTwo) are treated specially.
    for <c> and <p>: t is
        /m: Make user
        /r: Remove user
        /k: Kick user
    for <m>:
        /g
        /u
        /m
        /r
        /k
        /n
<q> means a kick, <q p2="room"> means you were kicked to a separate room.
same for <logout>

    j2 is a join message. h is homepage. a is avatar. n is displayed name. v is
    "w_td_userrev". N is your username "w_registered". d0, d1,... seem to be
    powers. dx is how many "xats" you have. m0, m1, m2, etc. seem to be "masks".
    f seems to be an autologin flag (0 if true). "r" is "pass". c is the HTML id
    (room number maybe? "channel"?) z is always 11. y is the I element above.
    l2, l3, l4 seem to be timing information.
