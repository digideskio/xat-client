echo -n -e "<policy-file-request/>\000" | nc 174.36.242.42 10037
will give you a quick example of how it all goes down.

Code is in chat.as3. Not sure what to make of it.

onMsg is line chat.as3:5596.
line 12457 is 'myOnXML' which processes all recieved XML
line 10825 is 'doXatIM', which appears to parse CSV for some reason
'network class' begins in 12169

Tag list:
<y> is some kind of authentication.
<p> is a private message.
<c> is a control message.
<m> is a message.
<l> is logout? and <u> is login?
messages with attr t beginning with "/" (FirstTwo) are treated specially.
    for <c> and <p>: t is
        /m: Make user
        /r: Remove user
        /k: Kick user
    for <m>:
        /g Gag(ged?) user --  <m p="LOL GTFO" t="/g3600" u="232242656" d="256669076"/>
        /u
        /m
        /r
        /k
        /n
<q> means a kick, <q p2="room"> means you were kicked to a separate room.
same for <logout>
        
Here's a transcript of my conversation with the server (wireshark; native
client). The . at the end of every tag is a \00 character. > is sent, < is
recieved. attributes: u seems to be user ID (numeric), n is name (if
applicable), email and imtype? perhaps

>   <y m="1" />.
<   <y i="2021040961" c="1278089865" />.
          you need to remember I and C

>   <j2 l4="3603" l3="3561" l2="0" y="2021040961" k="-1703400679" k3="381394543" z="11" p="0" c="100867422" r="1833903872" f="0" u="256409089" m0="0" m1="0" m2="0" d0="0" d3="4992373" N="hotdog0003" n="gcr" a="http://i941.photobucket.com/albums/ad253/hotdog003/dresdencodak.png" h="" v="3" />.
    j2 is a join message. h is homepage. a is avatar. n is displayed name. v is
    "w_td_userrev". N is your username "w_registered". d0, d1,... seem to be
    powers. dx is how many "xats" you have. m0, m1, m2, etc. seem to be "masks".
    f seems to be an autologin flag (0 if true). "r" is "pass". c is the HTML id
    (room number maybe? "channel"?) z is always 11. y is the I element above.
    l2, l3, l4 seem to be timing information.
    

<   <p u="1" t="/m1833903872" />.
    This could be a private message indicating I've joined the server (see slash
    codes above)

<   <i b="http://i47.tinypic.com/307s39e.png;=;=1;=;=" f="0" v="1" r="3" />.
      This image is the room background.

    What follows is recent messages just before I arrived.
<   <m t="because they are in love &lt;3 :] hehe" u="211513178_5" n="______(mgp)__.wau!wa.__(mgp)________._________.______...____.__a__.g_______.___________.____.___a_________.." a="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr343/Timmc5/Eminem.jpg#up#hearts" h="www.xat.com/eminem_fanz" v="5" i="14424" s="1" />.
        because I haven't seen that "u" before, I'm treated to their name (n),
        avatar (a), etc.
        Note that 'lurkers' are treated differently (they have <o> tags for old
        users, <u> tags for new ones)
